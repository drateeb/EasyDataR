# EasyDataR
EasyDataR is a unofficial R package to read in data from EasyData platform of the State Bank of Pakistan

# Details about EasyData of the State Bank of Pakistan
EasyData platform of the State Bank of Pakistan is the largest repository of Macroeconomic time-series. It has more than 2 million observations covering more than 11,000 time-series related to economy of Pakistan. 

# About the package
This package is intended to identify a session with EasyData API key, obtain information about a particular series of interest, and download a series of interest to R for further analysis. Although, I could have added reading in the series as time-series object in R and conduct basic analysis such as:

1. Plotting the time-series
2. Unit-Root tests
3. Seasonality tests
4. Cointegration tests and Cointegrated vector autoregressive model
5. Autoregressive and Vector Autoregressive models
6. Forecasting using Machine Learning and Dynamic Factor models (Rolling and Fixed Window Forecast)
7. In and Out-of-Sample Forecasts

But this package is not intended to conduct these analysis but I am programming another one, which will be able to perform all of these operations. Stay Tuned!
