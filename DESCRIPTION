Description: This package reads in data series from the EasyData Platform hosted by the State Bank of Pakistan - Central Bank of Pakistan. There are more than 10,000 time-series available on this platform. Academicians, reseachers, and students can download these series into R using this package. It is important to note that this package is intended to read the data and not to perform time-series analysis in detail, this is why it only offers simple features. Analysis using this dataset is author's one of the work-in-progress projects.
